# Zine LocalWiki Template

A LocalWiki template for zines. The template was created by Mary Barnett for the Chattanooga Zine Library, which uses LocalWiki as a catalog.

## Usage

This template may be used for any city with LocalWiki. For our purposes, we will use Chattanooga.

### 1. Create the page for the zine you'd like

You can do that by following these steps:

* Go to https://localwiki.org/cha/.
* Click the `Add a new page` button in the upper right-hand corner of the page.
* Type the title of the page you want and press enter.
* You will now see a large text box where you can enter content.

### 2. Paste in the template

Now you can paste in the zine template. Assuming you followed the steps for creating a page, here's how you paste in the template:

* In the toolbar right above the large text box, there is a button that says `Source`. Click that button.
* Remove the text shown after you clicked the `Source` button.
* The code for the template is located [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChattanoogaPublicLibrary/zine-localwiki-template/master/zine.html). Paste the contents of the template into the large text box.
* Click the `Source` button again.
* From here, you can edit the page as you'd like.

### 3. Edit the page created from the template

Now, you you should see the page, but with placeholders. Replace the placeholders with the appropriate information about the zine you're entering in to the catalog.
